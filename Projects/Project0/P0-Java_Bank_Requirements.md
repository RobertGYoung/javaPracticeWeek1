### Presentation tips

Here are some tips to consider to help improve your presentation skills. Note that you are not required to have slides for Project 0, but you may for later projects.

- Be energetic while you present
- Be confident during your presentation
- Make sure everyone in the room can hear your voice
- Use voice modulations to enhance the impact of what you are saying, else you will sound monotonous
- Involve the audience. Ask questions or take a quick vote with a show of hands.
- Use a little bit of humor in your presentation. It will help engage the audience.
- Do not fold your hands while presenting
- Do not put hands in your pockets
- Use your hands, gesture, etc. to emphasize what you are saying and create more impact
- Avoid filler words like Umm, and aaâ€¦
- Maintain eye contact with the audience
- Avoid looking at the floor or ceiling while presenting
- Use the lighthouse technique - looking across the room making eye contact with everyone while speaking
- If presenting together, then pay attention to what your teammate is saying instead of looking at the ceiling or floor
- Do not eat while you present (especially chewing gum)
- Do not present with your back towards the audience
- Do not put long paragraphs in slides
- Have bullet points
- Use one picture per slide to make the slide more appealing. However, only use professional-looking pictures
